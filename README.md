A light weighted car pool application that helps you find a companion who wants to travel in the same route as of yours. You can either' offer a ride' or 'request a drop'. This app is integrated with google maps - for selecting the source & destination. When you find a companion, both the parties are informed via notifications.
The 'Quick Search' tab help you with list of active rides or drops. You may select one from the list if it suits you.
The 'History' tab maintain the 5 most recent routes you traveled. You may also pick one from that list as well when you plan to car pool.
